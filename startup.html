          <li><strong>What problem will your proposed technology/product/service solve? How will it directly relate to the Digital Health Challenge statement? Why is it a problem, who is affected and at what order of magnitude? How is the problem being dealt with today? What motivated the team to try and solve this problem?</strong></li>       
<br>  
         <p>Our product, Chef Cart, solves the problem of adopting and maintaining a healthy diet. By combining  mobile devices, publicly accessible API's, and private consumer shopping data we can create a more convenient and health focused grocery shopping experience for customers. Purchasing and consuming food is a problem that affects every member of society and retail supermarket sales in 2013 topped $638 billion. Today the problem is being primarily dealt with through advisement and education. Medical professionals provide nutritional 
            advice. Government initiatives such as ChooseMyPlate provide educational and advice. Traditional marketing and media also rely heavily on influencing consumer behavior through advising them what products are "healthy" and how they should consume them. Our team was motivated to solve this problem because our own personal experience trying to adopt a healthy diet. As a family, we chose to cook more often and move towards a more vegan diet, but we found the most difficult part of the transition was the grocery shopping experience.</p>
        
          <li><strong>What is your proposed idea/product/technology? How will it solve the stated problem and address the Digital Health Challenge? Does your solution completely eliminate the problem or does it solve it partially? Give us a sense for the relative magnitude of your solution.</strong></li>
<br>
          <p>Chef Cart is a mobile app that partners with grocery retailers to help customers eat healthier, save time, and skip the lines. We are changing the in-store shopping experience by allowing customers to use their mobile devices to scan items into their cart, keep track of how healthy they are shopping, gain access to real-time suggestions and coupons, and checkout directly from their device. Outside of the store we aggregate the customers shopping information within the app and display it in informative charts and visuals so that they 
             can gain insights into their diet. This also gives the grocery retailer added points of contact with the consumer outside of the store in forms other than simply advertising. Our solution partially solves the problem, but we feel that it removes the majority of the friction and lowers barriers that currently inhibit consumers from shopping healthy, and therefore adopting and maintaining a healthy diet. If a retailer such as Kroger partnered on our platform our product could be used in over 2,600 stores and be a POS for millions of 
             transactions per year. At scale we believe our consumer facing app could connect dozens of retailers with 10's of millions of users per day.</p>
          <li><strong>How does your proposed technology/product/service work? What databases, technology and infrastructure will be involved? Do you have a working prototype?  Please be concise, but also clear and articulate in simple terms. Assume that the reader is not an expert in the field.</strong></li>
 <br>
          <p>Chef Cart integrates the functionality of several mobile apps, including some retailer mobile apps, to let customers have a more independent in-store shopping experience and gain insights on the healthiness of their purchases. Because we want to allow users to pay directly from their mobile device we would utilize both the iOS and Android app development systems. Our product would need to communicate with retailers' other payment transaction systems  and databases, like the USDA's Nutrient Database, to obtain health information and 
            calculate a healthiness score of the consumer's purchases. We currently do not have a functioning prototype, but have manually simulated many of the health functions of our application through our Facebook community.</p>
	
	  <li><strong>What is the unique value proposition of your idea? What makes it different from the competition or alternative approaches? Is it improving another existing product or service or is it original? Explain why the idea is better than current approaches.  What are the unique aspects of your product/service idea that provide you with a sustainable competitive advantage?</strong></li>
<br>
          <p>Our value proposition is that we make grocery shopping a more convenient and insightful experience. We believe that eating healthy starts with shopping healthy. For customers we are able to help them make healthier food choices, see valuable data about their shopping habits, save money, and decrease their time in the store. For retailers we help them to better serve their customers by giving them a mobile POS system that requires no up-front capital investment, access to valuable user shopping data off their network, and a competitive 
             advantage over competitors. This is a substantially different approach than our competitors have taken by creating physical hardware POS systems that cost 10's of thousands of dollars and require a humans to operate. Even when compared to self checkout systems used today in grocery stores our solution is incredibly cheaper, serves infinitely more people, and increases customer sentiment. We feel we are better than alternative products that track the healthiness of your diet and let you create shopping lists because they are only used 
             outside of the store and are not part of the shopping experience. Chef Cart is an original app that leverages the infrastructure and customer base of proven retailers. Our product has a sustainable competitive advantage because as a platform we would not only be the first mobile POS system integrated into multiple retailers, but we would be perfectly positioned to drive future innovation through integrations with products such as Google Glass virtual reality. We also have the ability to transition our product into new verticals and take on in-store retail as a whole.</p>

         <li><strong>Competition: Who is trying to solve the problem today? List your direct competitors, indirect competitors, potential competitors, and alternative solutions. Indicate if these competitors have commercially available products or services, or if they are still in development. How is your product or service differentiated from your competition's product or service?</strong></li>
<br>
         <p>Today there are two major attempts to solve the in-store shopping problem, self checkout lanes and online shopping. Self checkout lanes which include touch screen monitors, payment modules, barcode scanner, etc.  are manufactured and sold by companies such as IBM, Fujitsu, NCR, and ECRS. According to dawinmag.com, a normal four-lane setup costs $125,000 for purchase and installation, and doesn't include servicing programs. They are currently installed in 96% of U.S. supermarkets. Our solution on the other hand requires zero additional 
            hardware or up front capital expenditures and can service infinitely more customers at one time. Also, these systems are stationary and do not provide any value to customers beyond the point of sale. Our solution provides value before, during, and after a customer's shopping experience, and is 100% mobile.
            Some stores have attempted to do online grocery shopping for delivery and pickup, and some startups such as Instacart have gained traction in urban areas with a similar "personal shopper/assistant" model. Our solution is more valuable though because it addresses a larger target market, is more easily adopted, and is more in line with the current behaviors of our target market. Where as delivery services can only support densely populated urban areas, our solution can be adopted by all shoppers regardless of the store they are visiting or the time. 
            Chef Cart also has significantly greater adoptability because the majority of customers are already utilizing their phones within the store anyways through shopping lists, recipe apps, and for general communication. We believe that the synergies between the retailer and the customer are far greater for our mobile enabled POS system and the technology applications can be easily transition beyond grocery and into all forms of retail.</p>

	 <li><strong>Describe the market for your idea/product/service. What are specific market applications that your idea targets?</strong></li>
<br>
	 <p>Our target market is again two sided. It consists of grocery shoppers who own an Apple or Android device, as well as grocery retailers who currently employ consumer facing web or mobile applications. We are specifcally targeting major operators with more than 100 stores under management and in excess of $1 billion in annual sales. Health focused and progressive operators such as Kroger and Whole Foods are more likely to adopt our technology, but we also see regional players such as Lowes Foods being able to utilize this technology to lure customers away from competitors.</p>

	<li><strong>How big is your idea in terms of the total market and the segment served? What data sources are used to support your figures?</strong></li>
<br>
	<p>Specific targets that have identified include Kroger, Whole Foods, Lowes Foods, and Publix. These operators currently maintain 4,204 locations and with over $150 billion in annual revenue. As an industry there are currently 37,716 supermarkets that totaled $638 billion in sales in 2014 and employee more than 3.4 million people. Research sources include Food Marketing Institute, Bureau of Labor and Statistics and Supermarket News. 
           On the customer side the number of smartphone users is projected to pass 2 billion in 2016. In the U.S. there are over 171 million smartphone users, and the majority of them shop at a supermarket every week. In fact, each day 1 in 7 adults makes a trip to the grocery store and more than 5% of our total income is spent there.</p>

	<li><strong>How fast is the market growing?</strong></li>
<br>
	<p>Supermarket sales have grown 1.3% year over year, but are losing share of total food purchases to dining out. Specifically in the U.S. people are now spending more money on dining out than they do on groceries, and among Millennials the ratio is nearly 2:1. This is a trend that grocers drastically want to reverse.</p>

	<li><strong>What external factors could have an impact on your market – political, economic, social or technological?</strong></li>
<br>	
	<p>External factors that could impact our market are changes in food regulations by government organizations that require increased awareness and health education,  or a change in customer sentiment towards shopping at supermarkets.</p>

	<li><strong>Who are the customers for the idea? Who is being served and who will pay for the product/service? Have you received external validation from potential customers that your product idea is viable?</strong></li>
<br>
	<p>Chef Cart's customers would be the grocery retailers such as Kroger, Whole Foods, etc. The product would serve all of their customers who have an Apple or Android device. For even a single retailer such as Kroger our technology could be interacting with millions of users from day one. We have validated the idea through interviews and surveys with 33 grocery shoppers. 30% indicated that they currently used their primary grocers mobile app, but 85% said that they would enjoy utilizing our product to increase the convenience of their shopping experience. 100% take their phone into the store with them.</p>

	<li><strong>What is the revenue model for the idea? What is the overall estimated revenue opportunity?</strong></li>
<br>
	<p>We plan to utilize either a Saas model with 1 year subscriptions or a transaction charge. The price of the subscriptions would be based on the number of stores under service with each store costing the $10,000 per year. For example, if a retailer such as Kroger were to implement our technology into all of their store location then we would charge $26,250,000 (2625 locations x $10,000) per year for a software subscription. We believe retailers can more than recoup this cost in increased sales, reduced wages, and reduced software development costs. At scale if we were utilized 50% of all supermarket sites we would generate $185 million per year in revenue. 
Another alternative is to utilize a 1% transactional charge. This would essentially make the software free to any retailers who wanted to use it and charge a fee of 1% of the amount of transactions processed. Again assuming that a retailer such as Kroger adopted the technology and $50 million in transactions took place through the mobile app then we would be paid $500,000. This may reduce barriers to entry and if adopted at scale and 50% of all grocery retail transactions took place through our platform then we would generate $3.19 billion per year.</p>

	<li><strong>What are the steps and timeline for commercialization and generating revenue?</strong></li>
<br>
	<p>Step one would be to further develop the team. Step two would be to create an MVP in the form of a stand alone app to market for a pilot. Step three would be to implement our technology with one retailer's mobile app and market it in a small number of stores. Step four would be to fully integrate into the POS systems that are currently used by the pilot retailer in all of their locations. Step five would be to capture new accounts and scale out. 
Our projected timeline is 3 months developing the core of the team. 6 months to develop an MVP strong enough to warrant a pilot. 3 months to attract and integrate with a pilot customers technology stack. 3 months to run a live pilot and iterate on the product generating $10,000 from the pilot. 6 months to finalize and implement full functionality for initial customer in all locations utilizing the validated business model. From this stage forward we would be either exit through acquisition or continue to capture new accounts.</p>

	<li><strong>How will the idea reach its customers? Describe how you market and sell the product or service. (i.e. direct sales, indirect sales, web based, etc.). Are there any critical partners or licensing agreements that will be required?  Are there alternative partnerships that are viable substitutes?</strong></li>
<br>
	<p>We would reach our customers through direct sales. Our team would secure a pilot bid with each customer and then work our way up from there to fulling serving all locations. We plan to hire someone to lead our sales initiative and over time build out a full sales team to drive growth and acquire new customers. Because our end users would be the customers we would want to partner with the grocery retailers to market the new functionality of the mobile apps and increase usage and adoption. We see this as a joint effort in which we help our customers to increase the utilization of their app while at the same time increasing our revenue. Other critical partners are the app stores such as the iPhone app store and Google play store who host the retailers apps.</p>

	<li><strong>Describe the estimated capital requirements for the launch or your product/service and how the capital will be used.</strong></li>
<br>
	<p>Our goal is to raise $200,000 seed to develop our initial mvp and then $2 million series A to build out the team and begin full scale pilot. We plan to hire two initial engineers to help with the development of the MVP bringing our team size to 4. Our projected burn rate would be $20,000 per month giving us 10 months of initial runway to get the product built and secure a pilot customer. Upon raising a series A we would increase the size of the team to 9. Positions would include CEO, head of operations, head of product, head of sales & marketing, 4 engineers, and one designer. Our projected burn rate would then increase to $80,000 giving us 25 months of projected runway to either reach an exit or raise a series B. Our timeline however projects that we will reach revenue after 9 months and become cashflow positive after 12 months. Reaching these milestones will greatly increase the flexibility of our runway and the likelihood of a liquidity event for our early stage investors.</p>
